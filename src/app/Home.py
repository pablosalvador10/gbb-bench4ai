            ### 🌟 Getting Started with the Deployment Center

            Adding new deployments allows you to compare performance across multiple MaaS deployments. Follow this step-by-step guide to add and manage your deployments:

            **Step 1: Add Your MaaS Deployment**

            1. Navigate to the `Deployment Center` located at the top of the sidebar.
            2. You will find two sections: `Add your MaaS deployment` and `Loaded deployments`.
                - `Add your MaaS deployment`: Here, you can add a new deployment.
                - `Loaded deployments`: This section displays deployments that are already loaded and ready to use.
            3. To add a new deployment, proceed to the next step.
        
            **Step 2: Add Deployment Details**
            - Fill in the form with the following details:
                - **Deployment ID:** Your chat model deployment ID.
                - **Azure OpenAI Key:** Your Azure OpenAI key (treated as confidential).
                - **API Endpoint:** The endpoint URL for Azure OpenAI.
                - **API Version:** The version of the Azure OpenAI API you're using.
                - **Streaming:** Select 'Yes' if the model will output in streaming mode.
            - Click **Add Deployment** to save your deployment to the session state.

            **Step 3: View and Manage Deployments**
            - Your deployments will be listed under **Loaded Deployments**.
            - Click on a deployment to expand and view its details.
            - You can update any deployment details and click **Update Deployment** to save changes.
            - To remove a deployment, click **Remove Deployment**.

            ### 🌟 Managing Deployments in the Deployment Center
            - Deployments are stored in the Streamlit `session_state`, allowing them to persist across page reloads and be accessible across different pages of the app.
            - This flexibility allows you to easily compare the performance of different deployments and make adjustments as needed.

            **Updating Deployments Across Pages**
            - Any updates made to a deployment from one page are reflected across the entire app, allowing seamless switching between different deployments or updating their configurations without losing context.
